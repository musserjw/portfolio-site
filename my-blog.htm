    <h2>My story</h2>

    <p>Hi, I'm Jeff.  I've never written a blog before, so this is my first shot at it.</p>
    <p>I am a middle age guy who works in an office writing computer code for a living.  I am a husband of 26 years, a father, and a grand father, both boys.  The type of work that I currently do will be 
      coming to an end soon, so I decided to take the Udacity Full Stack Developer course to learn a new skillset, so that I will be ready to transition when the time comes.  I like to think that I 
      have had an interesting life so far, so here are the highlights.  Hope you enjoy!</p>

    </figure>

    <p>We'll start in High School.  I was a decent student, never really excelled at anything, but then I never really put forth a lot of effort either.  However, I have always had an interest in computers
      and technology in general.  My addiction began when my neighbor wanted to show me his computer.  I had never seen one before, so he wrote a quick little loop to fill up the screen
      with my name.  I freaked out!  How did you do that!  That's amazing!  I couldn't believe that typing just a few lines of code could do that.  You could make it do whatever you want, I thought to
      myself!  Birthday comes, BAM, new Commodore 64.  Got the book out, learned basic, wrote my first program.  I was so proud, showed my mom, who didn't quite get out of it what I did, but I didn't care.
      Wow, time to eat, wait what?  How do I save it.  I need a floppy drive???  A hundred and fifty dollars???   So yes, I would write a program run it over and over again until I was bored.  And then
      turn it off and write another one the next day.  This went on until Christmas!  Best Christmas ever, got my drive, some blank floppies, and a couple of games to play.  Nothing could stand in my
      way from becoming a world class programming genius now!    Except a girl...</p>
    
    <p>Ok, so that didn't last long!  Oh well, fast forward to 1987, back to computing.  Got into it pretty heavy.  I learned that you could hook up your phone to your computer and actually type back and forth with other 
      live people!  There was a whole other world out there, where if you had the right phone number you could connect to different bulletin boards where you could post messages for everyone to read.  
      You could even call the phone company and talk to their computers so that you could... well we won't get into that.</p>
    <p>Okay, so I've lived in my computer world for long enough, graduation is close, so it's time to think about what I want to do for a living once I graduate.  So, I like tech, I'll take the
      electronics class for my final year.  Perfect.  Amazing, once again, I can put just a few components together and make amazing things happen.  This is one class that I really applied myself and 
      decided, this is what I want to do for a living!

    <p>I finally made it.  Graduation day, now I can get on with my life.  But first thing's first.  I have always been a very patriotic person and have been very thankful of all of the luxuries that
      we take for granted in this country, so I decided it was time for me to pay back.  I joined the United States Marine Corps Reserves, knowing that one day my services would be called upon.  Bootcamp came 
      just ten days after graduation, I was so excited, yet scared to death at the same time.  I heard it was hell.  And it pretty much was.  Thirteen weeks of summer in Paris Island, South Carolina.  Physically, I think anyone can be conditioned to make it 
      through.  It is the mental toughness that causes people to drop out.  It doesn't matter how many pushups you can do, or how fast you can run if you can't keep it together when you are being shot 
      at, yet at the same time you have to run toward the enemy.  Don't get me wrong, physicality is important and so is being able to shoot, sleep and hunger deprevation, being able to endure the 
      elements, swimming, strategic combat scenarios, navigation, the art of concealment, and so many other things.  The bottom line is that when you leave you are a higly skilled killer.</p>
    <p>Bootcamp changed me in so many ways that I can't even say.  You definitely enter as a boy and come out as a man.  I think everyone should go through the experience, it teaches you toughness,
       courage, and discipline.  As well as being physically fit and being able to defend yourself, friends, and family.  My job in the Marine Corps was in the infantry.  As part of that, my skills 
       in combat were honed even further when I went to the Marine Corps School of Infantry for the next four months after graduating boot camp.  Four, or five days out of the week we lived in the bush 
       in the middle of November in North Carolina.  Upon completion I returned home and began life as a civilian again, albeit with a completely different view of people and life in general.

      <figcaption>Back to School</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>After making it back home in one piece it was time for some rest and relaxation.  I spent about a month getting re-adjusted to civilian life and got a job and an education.  I remembered how much 
      I loved my electronics class in high school and enrolled in a two year program to get an associates degree in electronics.  I was really good at it.  Everything just made sense and it came very 
      natural to me.  This went on for about a year, same routine, worked at taco bell for 8 hours, changed clothes, went to school for four hours, every night.  Just like in High School, things were going 
      so smoothly, nothing could stop me from becoming one of the top engineers in my field!  Except for one thing.  You guessed it.  Another girl!  This time it was different.  I had never 
      experienced anything quite like it.  For the first time I met someone who really got me.  There was this strange unbreakable bond between us that couldn't really be explained.  I had to be with this 
      person every waking moment.  I was like a hopeless addict that just couldn't get enough.  My friends were ignored, parents rarely seen, and I missed the max number of days possible while still being 
      able to stay enrolled in school.  Three months later we're saying 'I do'!  BAM! One month later we're expecting.  Life just got a whole lot more interesting.</p>
    
    <p>This brings us into the 90's.  This wole thing wasn't exactly thought through, or planned the way that it should have been, but I wouldn't change one part of it.  Needless to say we struggled.  
      Financially speaking there was very little room for error.  I was a college student working at Taco Bell during the day, school at night.  She was a medical records clerk working while pregnant, 
      both of us trying to scrape together enough funds to support a new family.  We just couldn't wait until our new addition got here.  Then, finally, HE is here!  It's a boy!  Actually, while she 
      was delivering I was so overcome with the fact that my child was being born right in front of my eyes that it didn't even register when the doctor told me it was a boy.  My mother was like Jeff, he 
      said its a boy!  Oh, yeah, it's a boy!  Yes!</p>
    <p>Everything went well, five fingers, five toes.  I'll never forget the first night home from the hospital.  It was like we were sleeping on top of the sheets.  The first smallest, slightest cry 
      from our newborn sent us flying up out of the bed and in there to check on him.  I wish I could have been a fly on the wall, it had to have been hilarious from an outsider's view.  Now, I wish I 
      could tell you all of the wonderful things that happen during your newborn child's first seven months, but my life was about to take an unexpected turn that had no certain outcome...

      <figcaption>Let there be WAR!</figcaption>
    </figure>
 
    <p>In December of 1990 I was called to active duty status in the United States Marine Corps to take part in Operation Desert Sheild/Desert Storm.  I was still in school, about to graduate.  
      In fact, the very night that I was shipping 
      out, I put on a cap and gown over my cammies and boots, shook hands, got my diploma and picture, went back to the reserve center and got on the truck to leave.  I was litterally waiving good bye 
      to my wife and son as we drove away.  That was hard.  I lost my father to cancer when he was 26, I never met him.  And I couldn't help but think that the same thing might be happening to my son, I 
      was only 20.  It had to be even harder for my wife, at least I knew what the situation was on the ground.  She was left at home just wondering.  Would she be rasing a child alone, without a father?  
      How would she make it alone?  Our lives had just begun together.  We didn't know when we would be able to talk to each other again.  All communication was done through letters and tape recordings 
      half way across the world.  This would be one of the most challenging times in my life.

      <figcaption>The Ground War</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>After about a month into the war, the ground war started.  The United States quickly and easily swept through the southern part of Iraq taking
      in thousands and thousands of POWs.  The enemy offered absolutely no resistance and I was spared the burden of having to kill another man.  Not 
      that I would have hesitated to do my job, and with precision, but I think that when people are watching the fight from home, they forget that this 
      is not a movie and that the guys on the other side, for the most part are just like me, trying to do their job and get back home to their family.
      Today we have ISIS, which is a whole other story.  They are just evil people who enjoy killing.  There is just no other way to put it.  I would take 
      great pleasure in taking out as many of them as possible.  Enough said about that.
    </p>
    <p>A few months after the war ended I returned home to crowds of cheering people, my wife, and my newborn sone!  Life just doesn't get any better!

      <figcaption>Back to Work</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Life was pretty tough when I got back.  Interview after interview people wanted to hear all about the war, but didn't want to hire.  My 
      electronics degree was useless.  I went from job to job, never could really hold one down.  Partly my fault, due to my immaturity, but also due to 
      just some really bad luck and timing.  I finally managed to find a job fixing copiers, that lasted for a while, then odd jobs here and there, until a 
      friend of mine got me a job as a PC tech.  That is when everything turned around for me.  I really didn't know too much about computers, other than
      what I had taught myself.  I already had a good foundation in troubleshooting from my electronics experience, so it was a perfect fit.  Time passed 
      and as I proved myself I was offered a promotion as a PeopleSoft ERP developer.  Once again I knew notheing about PeopleSoft and had to teach myself 
      what it was and how it worked, since I would be the one implementing it for the whole company.  Things went well and I excelled in my new position.
    </p>
    <p>Life went on, job changes, ups and downs in life.  The next several years were amazing.  We were really involved in our son's life as he went through 
      high scool.  Football games, girl friends, friends, parties.  We made sure that his childhood was as memorable as it could have possibly been.  Yes, 
      there are a ton of things we could have done differently, but honestly I don't think he would change a thing.  He graduated High School, went on to 
      college to earn a Computer Science degree, and marry his high school sweetheart.  He now owns his own home, has a great job, and a newborn baby.  Our 
      goal as parents has been accomplished.  We made sure that our son has a better life than we had.  Not in a sense of happiness, but from the standpoint 
      that he did not have to go through the really, really, difficult struggles that we went through.

    <p>Currently, I work for Vanderbilt Medical Center as a software developer and couldn't be happier.  Still happily married to the same wonderful woman 
       of my dreams for 26 Years now.
       I feel like my life has turned out very well and I have been very blessed.  My wife has been my rock through all of the hard times that we have 
       gone through and I am very grateful to have her by my side.  I couldn't have made it without her.</p>
    <p>I am a lucky man.
